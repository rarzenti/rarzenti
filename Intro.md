Hello!
I'm Ryan. I've spent the few years of my life working as an engineer from a supply chain and operations standpoint. I graduated
from Penn State in 2016 holding a degree in mechanical engineering.

All things technical is kind of my jam. I started engineering because I liked solving problems and building things.
My hobbies are brazillian jiu jitsu, 3D printing, home cooking, and programming.

The latter brings me here. While I thoroughly enjoy mechanical & manufacturing engineering, I need something more.
I've found myself gravitating toward anything involving PLC programming, robotics, data analysis, or anything where
I get to solve a logical puzzle.

I've been talking to my life long friend & college roommate who works in the DevOps field and have been inspired to
take a slight change of course in my career trajectory... I hope...

My intent is to follow along with content posted by @MichaelCade1 "90DaysOfDevOps" and try to post my journey as I go.

Wish me luck.
